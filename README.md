Dungeon Construction<p>

1. Clone the github repo<br>
2. Initialse an eclipse workspace (default is fine, as long as the workspace is NOT the github repo)<br>
3. File -> Import -> Gradle (Existing Gradle Project)<br>
4. Set the project root directory to the github repo, and take it one directory further. So ~/\*./LibGDXGradle<br>
